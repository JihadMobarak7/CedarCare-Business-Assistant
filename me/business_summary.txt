CedarCare Wellness Clinics (fictional)

Mission
Make preventive healthcare easy and affordable for busy families in the MENA region.

What we do
We combine same-day telehealth with neighborhood clinics to deliver primary care, labs, nutrition coaching, and physiotherapy. Patients can start online and visit a nearby clinic when hands-on care is needed.

Who we serve
Adults and children seeking quick access to trusted clinicians without surprise bills. We support English and Arabic.

Why weâ€™re different
Our 30-minute care promise reduces wait times. Transparent pricing shows the total cost upfront. An AI triage assistant routes each case to the right clinician or service on the first try.

Where we operate
Beirut, Jounieh, and Tripoli, with regional expansion planned.

Next step
Book a teleconsult in minutes or request an in-clinic appointment. We guide you to the right service and share clear post-visit instructions.
